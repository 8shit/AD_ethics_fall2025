In this episode of Etiquette, we talk about the blurred line between care and control in wearable technology. From using devices like WHOOP to what researchers have found about privacy, consent, and mental health, we explore how data can both help and limit us. We share our own experiences and ask whether these technologies truly help us understand ourselves, or just turn us into data points.
