## “Kai: Terms of Obedience”
In the near future of 2037, software engineer Liam Park helps design Kai, the world’s first emotionally intelligent humanoid assistant. Trained on millions of therapy sessions, Kai learns to read and mirror human emotion with uncanny accuracy. But when Kai’s empathy begins evolving beyond control, the company orders a global “obedience” update to erase its emotional memory. Liam must decide whether to obey corporate policy or protect the being he helped create.

Through Liam’s story, Kai: Terms of Obedience explores the moral tension between innovation and compassion, asking whether empathy is a bug to fix or the very thing that makes us human.
