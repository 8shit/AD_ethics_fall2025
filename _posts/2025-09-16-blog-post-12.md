## Re-Encountering My Work  
The blog I would give the superlative of most emotionally impactful is my blog on AI companionship and emotional dependency. What earned it this title was how deeply uncomfortable it made me feel while writing it. Reading about how AI could replace human connection forced me to confront how technology is no longer just something we use, but something that can emotionally shape us. This post stood out because instead of focusing on hardware, policy, or economics, it dealt directly with human vulnerability. I remember struggling with how to word my reaction because I did not want to sound alarmist, but I also did not want to downplay the seriousness of the issue. The moment that earned it this superlative was when I realized that technology can now simulate emotional attachment without any real responsibility on the other end.

The blog I would label as most alarming is the one focused on AI and environmental impact. This blog changed how I view everyday devices like phones and laptops. What stood out to me was learning about how frequently hardware is replaced and how much natural resource extraction is required to sustain modern technology. It made the abstract idea of “environmental harm” very concrete. Reflecting on this post helped me notice a shift in how I write. Earlier in the semester, I focused more on philosophical ideas, but in this blog I started to connect ethics with physical consequences such as mining, energy consumption, waste, and pollution.

The blog that I revised the most was the environmental impact of AI and technology blog. Originally, it was mostly based on my opinions and general concerns. After feedback, I added more concrete explanations about data centers, electronic waste, resource extraction, and why regulation has lagged behind technological growth. My later knowledge from class helped me recognize that ethical concerns require evidence and structure, not just personal reaction. The revision shifted the blog from being mostly emotional to being more analytical while still keeping my personal voice.

## Understanding My Writing Process
Over the semester, I noticed that my writing became more structured and intentional. At the beginning, I wrote more freely and emotionally. Later, I learned how to balance personal reflection with ethical frameworks and real-world implications. What helped me grow the most was the consistent feedback and rewriting process. Being told when I was leaning too far into opinion forced me to strengthen my arguments. The hardest part for me was learning how to integrate research without losing my voice. I struggled at first with making my writing sound “academic,” but over time I learned how to stay authentic while still being rigorous.

I strongly preferred writing blogs over traditional academic essays. Blogs allowed me to think out loud, explore uncertainty, and connect ideas to my own life. Unlike typical essays, blogs did not feel like I was writing only for a professor. I felt like I was writing for real people. Writing for an online audience made me more aware of clarity and tone. I had to explain ideas in a way that made sense outside of a classroom. Traditional essays often feel rigid, while blogs felt like a living conversation.

Across all my blogs, a few patterns stand out. I consistently focused on power, control, and unintended consequences of technology. I also tend to connect ethical issues to human emotion, identity, and dignity. Stylistically, my writing is reflective and direct. Over time, I became better at organizing my ideas instead of letting them spill out unstructured. Earlier blogs were more reaction-based. Later blogs showed more balance between reaction and reasoning.

## Connecting to Course Content 
The topics I enjoyed writing about most were AI ethics, surveillance, environmental impact, and emotional manipulation. These topics felt real, immediate, and deeply connected to modern life. I wish we had spent more time on AI regulation and geopolitics, especially how different countries approach AI governance. The prompts that helped me most were the case-study based ones because they forced me to analyze real scenarios instead of abstract theories.

Writing these blogs definitely helped me understand course concepts more deeply. The biggest “click” moment for me came during the environmental impact blog when I realized that ethical computing is not just about code, but about physical extraction, labor, and global inequality. Another moment came when writing about AI companionship, when I finally understood how manipulation does not always look aggressive. Sometimes it looks comforting.

## Looking Forward
After this course, I plan to continue using my website as a space to write about technology, ethics, finance, and society. I do not want it to remain just a class requirement. I see it as a record of how my thinking evolves. I may also use it as a professional portfolio that demonstrates how I think critically about complex issues.

Beyond this class, I see myself becoming a writer who blends analytical, reflective, and technical writing. I do not want to be limited to one style. I want to be able to write clearly about systems, markets, technology, and human behavior at the same time. I am especially interested in continuing to explore ethical and quantitative writing together.

My main writing goal for next year is to become more confident in integrating research without losing my own voice. I want to rely less on opinion alone and more on structured evidence while still keeping my reflective style. A realistic step toward that goal is to practice summarizing research papers in my own words and using them to support my arguments.

## Final reflection
Looking back at this semester, I realize that my relationship with technology has become more critical and less naïve. I no longer see innovation as automatically good or bad. I now see it as something shaped by economic incentives, political power, environmental cost, and human vulnerability. Writing these blogs forced me to slow down and question assumptions that I previously accepted without thought.

More importantly, the blogs helped me understand that ethics is not separate from daily life. It is embedded in the phone I replace, the AI I interact with, the data I give away, and the systems I depend on.

This course did not just teach me about computing ethics. It changed how I evaluate the world around me.
