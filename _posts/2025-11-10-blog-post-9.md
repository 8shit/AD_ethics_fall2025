## When Truth Becomes a Battlefield: Free Speech in the Age of Misinformation  

Kevin A. I. Mills’s *“Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media”* explores whether moderating false information online helps society or damages it further. He argues that censorship often misses the real problem—not misinformation itself, but the **collapse of trust** between people and the institutions that once guided public knowledge. That argument made me think less about what’s true or false online and more about why so many people stopped believing experts in the first place.

Misinformation has always existed. Mills points out examples from yellow journalism to the Iraq War, showing that fake or exaggerated claims have shaped American history long before Twitter or Facebook. What’s new is how quickly ideas spread and how polarized our trust has become. Many of us no longer share a common sense of what counts as credible, and that’s what gives misinformation its power. I agree with Mills that social media didn’t invent this—it simply magnified it.

Censorship, even when it aims to protect the truth, can backfire. When platforms remove posts or ban users, they often reinforce the belief that “the system” is silencing certain voices. Instead of restoring order, it hardens distrust. As Mills argues, democracy depends on citizens being able to speak and reason together, even when they’re wrong. I think silencing people doesn’t rebuild credibility; it replaces discussion with resentment. Real progress would mean earning back trust, not enforcing it.

At the same time, digital media has made access to information easier than ever. We can learn from scientists directly, read government reports, or follow journalists in real time. Yet as Mills notes, context often disappears. A single clip or statistic can be shared endlessly without background, turning partial truths into full distortions. I’ve learned to look for sources that show their reasoning and admit uncertainty—because, as the reading emphasizes, **knowledge is social**. No one can “do their own research” in isolation.

One question I kept thinking about was: *What does it take for you to personally trust a source again after it loses credibility once?* Mills traces how public trust in information systems collapsed but doesn’t prescribe a clear path to rebuild it. For me, trust returns slowly—when a source admits mistakes, corrects them publicly, and stays transparent. But that process isn’t built into how we currently use the internet.

Writing this blog made me realize that the misinformation crisis isn’t really about speech—it’s about trust. Censorship might stop a rumor for a moment, but it can’t heal what’s broken underneath. If democracy depends on people listening to one another as equals, then the real challenge isn’t removing voices. It’s learning how to believe again.
