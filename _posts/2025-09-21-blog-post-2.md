**Article Reading:**  
[Seeing Through the Reality of Meta’s Smart Glasses — Brian X. Chen & Eli Tan, New York Times, Sept. 20, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/technology/personaltech/meta-smart-glasses-mark-zuckerberg.html)

### Why I Picked This Article  
I picked this article because it connects to the big question of surveillance and data collection in our everyday tech. Meta’s new glasses look like a step toward the future of computing, but they also bring huge privacy risks. This isn’t just about glitches or product design, it’s about how much we want companies to watch us.

### Argument from the Article  
- **P1:** The glasses failed badly in their demo.  
- **P2:** That shows they aren’t ready for mainstream adoption.  
- **P3:** Meta’s poor privacy record means people won’t trust them.  
- **C:** Therefore, Meta’s glasses will fail to gain widespread adoption.  

### Fallacy in the Argument  
This argument relies on a **hasty generalization**. A failed demo doesn’t mean the product is doomed forever. Lots of major tech launches were rough at first (like the iPhone). And people often ignore privacy issues when a product is fun or convenient.  

### Rebuttal Argument  
- **P1:** One bad demo doesn’t prove the glasses can’t succeed later.  
- **P2:** Consumers regularly accept privacy trade-offs for novelty or convenience.  
- **P3:** Meta has the money and time to keep trying until something sticks.  
- **C:** The article exaggerates — the glasses could still succeed despite early failures.  

### Alternative Argument (My Stance)  
Even if the product becomes technically good, the real danger is surveillance. If smart glasses go mainstream, we need to know exactly what data is collected, how long it lasts, and whether it can be copied or sold. Without that, the risks outweigh the benefits.  

### Recommendation  
I’d say **conditional yes**. The tech could be useful — less screen time, more accessibility, and benefits for different communities. But to be safe, there must be strict rules: clear recording indicators, real data deletion, and limits on storage. If companies can’t prove they protect users, the tech shouldn’t be widely adopted.  

### Reflection  
Doing this assignment helped me see how much articles can overfocus on product failures instead of bigger issues. Breaking it into premises showed me that glitches aren’t the real story — privacy is. For me, it’s not about whether Meta can fix the glasses, it’s about whether we can trust the data they collect.
