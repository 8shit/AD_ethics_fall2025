## Where Do *We* End and the AI Begin

Reading the ARTificial case study opened my eyes to how complicated the relationship between AI and creativity has become. The article argues that copyright law is not built for the world of generative AI, and I found myself agreeing. What really stood out to me is how much human work sits behind every model. Without artists and creators, there would be no training data at all. That makes me feel that compensation should exist, but I also understand how difficult it is to trace billions of tiny contributions inside one system. Even if compensation feels fair, copyright alone cannot solve that.

I also found myself thinking about whether AI training counts as fair use or something closer to infringement. Legally it might be seen as transformative. Ethically it still feels like using something without permission. The model learns from someone else’s work, and even if it never copies anything directly, that influence is still there.

The article pushed me to think about originality as well. I believe AI outputs feel both original and derivative. They transform ideas, but their roots come from somewhere. Even so, I do not see AI as an author. The human who prompts, edits, and chooses is still responsible for the final creation. In my view, creativity is about taking what you have and making something new with real effort. AI can help with that, but it should not replace the effort itself.

As AI becomes more common, I notice a growing difference between using it as a tool and relying on it to do the entire job. That difference matters, especially if we want to protect what makes human creativity meaningful.

## New Discussion Question

**How do we draw the line between using AI as a creative tool and outsourcing our creativity to it**

I chose this question because authenticity kept coming up as I read. It matters how much of a final work is the result of your thinking, and how much is produced by the system. The boundary is not always clear, and this reading made me want to interrogate that more.

## Reflection

This exercise helped me notice parts of the AI debate that I had not paid attention to before. There are many grey areas around creative use, ethics, and limits. It made me realize that new technology can expand what we can do, but it can also narrow our creative horizons if we rely on it too heavily. I did not walk away with a negative view of AI, but I did walk away with a clearer sense of how carefully we should use it.
