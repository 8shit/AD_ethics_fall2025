## Summary

The case study ARTificial: Why Copyright Is Not the Right Policy Tool to Deal with Generative AI argues that traditional copyright law is not equipped to handle the realities of generative AI. Because these models are trained on massive amounts of existing creative work, it becomes nearly impossible to clearly trace ownership, authorship, or fair compensation using current legal frameworks. The article challenges the idea that copyright alone can protect artists in a world where machines learn from billions of creative contributions at once.

## Discussion 

This reading immediately connected to how I personally use AI. I mostly rely on it for debugging projects and documenting code, not for creating art or writing for me. Because of that, I clearly see the difference between using AI as a support tool and using it as a replacement for creative labor. In technical fields, AI helps clarify and optimize work that already comes from me. But with art, it feels completely different. Generative models are trained directly on the work of artists who spent years developing their skill and style, and then that work gets remixed instantly without permission, credit, or compensation. That does not sit right with me at all.

I strongly believe artists should be compensated. Out of all industries affected by generative AI, art feels like one of the hardest hit. These models pull from paintings, illustrations, animations, and designs that already exist online, then generate outputs that are essentially a collage of that collective labor. Even if the output is technically “new,” the foundation of it comes from other people’s work. What makes it worse is that this process usually happens without consent. People’s life work is absorbed into training data without them even knowing it happened. That feels less like innovation and more like quiet appropriation.

Seeing prompts like “in the style of Studio Ghibli” or other famous artists honestly makes me mad. These artists spent their entire careers developing something unique, only for a tool to reproduce that aesthetic in seconds. That kind of speed and efficiency might look impressive on the surface, but it completely ignores the human struggle behind creative mastery. To me, that is not genuine creation. I would not consider AI-generated art to truly be “art” in the same sense, because the origin does not come from one imagination, one vision, or one lived experience. It comes from statistical pattern matching.

At the same time, I do understand why copyright law struggles here. The traditional idea of copyright depends on identifying a clear author, a clear original work, and a clear instance of copying. With generative AI, none of those boundaries are clean anymore. A model is influenced by millions of works at once. Legally, that makes enforcement extremely difficult. Ethically, however, it still feels wrong. Even if something is legally framed as “transformative,” it does not erase the fact that real people’s labor built the system.

My biggest fear here is not just compensation, but overreliance and the erosion of human originality. AI cannot introduce new ideas without humans first putting those ideas into the world. It can only rearrange what already exists. If people begin to fully outsource creativity to machines, then innovation itself becomes shallow. I want to see AI used to enhance human work, to help people reach higher levels faster, not to replace the thinking, struggle, and imagination that make creativity meaningful in the first place. Even though I am not an artist myself, I deeply respect creative labor, and I believe it deserves real protection.

## New Discussion Question

If generative AI depends entirely on human creativity to function, should artists have the right to opt out of training datasets entirely?

I included this question because most conversations focus on compensation after the fact, but not on consent at the beginning. If someone does not want their work used to train a model at all, I think that choice should matter just as much as payment.

## Reflection

This case study forced me to think more seriously about how fragile the concept of originality has become in the age of generative AI. Before this, I mainly thought of AI as a productivity tool for problem-solving and efficiency. Now, I see how deeply it reaches into questions of ownership, creativity, and value. I walked away from this reading more critical than before, but not completely anti-AI. I still believe AI can be powerful when used to support human effort rather than replace it.

What stayed with me most is the idea that just because something is technologically possible does not mean it is ethically justified. Art is not just content. It is identity, labor, and voice. If we allow systems to consume that without boundaries, then we are not just automating tasks, we are reshaping what creation even means. This exercise helped me clarify where I personally stand: hopeful about what AI can do, but firmly critical of how it is currently being used in creative spaces.
