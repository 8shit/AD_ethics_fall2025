## Summary  
This case study explains how generative AI works with text and with images, and how it might mess up when knowing the true nature of its analysis.

## Discussion: Environmental Impact  
In the future I see AI being used more in daily life, maybe instead of Google or maybe for normal tasks we all do. People will adapt to it like they did with past tech like phones and computers. At first everyone resists change and says tech makes people dumber, but then it becomes normal and even helpful. With every new wave of tech the challenge shifts. We don’t have to calculate or graph by hand anymore because machines do it, but that means our mind now has new kinds of challenges.  

For AI, I don’t know if it will really substitute something specific, but I can see it becoming like one platform for everything. It feels like instead of a personal computer, you’d just need a portal to access some machine running AI, and that cuts costs.  

About energy, I feel like at the end of the day we are bound to use energy one way or another, whether it’s computing power or something else. Honestly I think by now we should be able to offset the environmental cost, maybe just plant enough trees to balance it. But no one talks about that. To me it feels like the cycle is simple: we burn, we use, trees return CO2 back to O2, then we die and decompose and create more fuel. It’s the natural cycle, even if we overcomplicate it.  

So I think policymakers should look at AI openly, see both the good and the bad, and not just panic or glorify it. They should decide with clear eyes, not fear.

## My Question  
**How will we see AI adapt in the next decade? Is it going to elevate us like other tech did, or is it going to dumb us down?**  

I chose this because I think AI is mostly made to make things easier, not necessarily more efficient. Like with learning, sometimes it feels like it makes us lazier instead of sharper.

## Reflection  
It’s weird because I use AI sometimes, but I feel guilty after. It makes me feel like I should be elevating myself instead of being more lazy. But maybe that’s just how every generation feels when new tech comes in. We’ll see if it actually pushes us forward or just makes us comfortable.
