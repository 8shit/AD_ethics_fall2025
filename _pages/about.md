Welcome to my site, where I share my academic and professional journey at the intersection of finance, technology, and ethics. Here you’ll find my case studies, which showcase applied projects and research, alongside podcasts and blog posts that reflect on key readings and ideas I’ve explored. Each section highlights how I connect theory with practice, whether through analyzing markets, building quantitative models, or considering the broader ethical implications of technology in finance. By navigating through the site, you’ll gain a clear picture of my interests, the skills I’m developing, and the questions I’m most passionate about investigating.


About Me
---
My name is Alex Dagher, and I’m a Computer Science and Economics student in the Economics and Computer Science Department
at St. Olaf College. I’m pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science and Economics, expected in May 2026.

My academic journey blends technical and financial disciplines, allowing me to explore how data, algorithms, and quantitative reasoning can shape real-world decision-making in markets and business. Professionally, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships in software engineering, data analysis, and machine learning. Most recently, I worked at Euler Data Solutions in Beirut, where I built Spring Boot microservices and integrated locally hosted large language models for structured financial analysis. Previously, I developed forecasting and recommendation models as a Machine Learning & Data Analyst Intern at Cafézal in Milan.

These experiences have strengthened my ability to bridge technology and finance, a focus that drives both my academic and career goals.

Research 
---
I’m particularly interested in the intersection of finance, technology, and quantitative methods. My current focus is on:

Quantitative Finance & Trading Systems: Building data-driven models for forecasting, portfolio optimization, and risk management.

Machine Learning Applications in Economics: Using AI to improve forecasting, pricing, and decision-making.

Quantum Computing in Finance: Exploring how quantum algorithms can introduce new methods of randomness, optimization, and analysis.

Beyond the technical, I’m also drawn to questions of ethics in finance and technology. Specifically:

How should algorithmic trading balance efficiency with market fairness?

What responsibilities do technologists have when designing tools that shape global markets?

How can financial technology be made more inclusive and transparent, ensuring access beyond large institutions?

Personal Life
---
I was born and raised in a multicultural environment and am fluent in English, Arabic, and French, which gives me a global perspective in both academic and professional settings. Outside of my studies, I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, global markets, and innovation—whether that’s building quantitative trading strategies, exploring investment opportunities, or designing technology-driven solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, cooking (often experimenting with different cuisines), and following international markets and economic trends. I’m also deeply motivated by opportunities to connect across cultures and apply my skills to projects that blend creativity, analysis, and impact.
